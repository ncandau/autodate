# autodate
Trainable dating app that suggests matches based on physical similarities to highly rated pics. New users will fill out a profile like in most dating applications. After they upload a few pictures, they will have the option of being auto-matched. Users who opt-in will be shown a series of "benchmark" pictures. For each picture, the user is asked to rate the attractiveness of the person shown on a scale from 1 to 10. After sufficient data is built up, Autodate will look for similarities among those pictures rated highly, and those rated low. It will then scan its picture database to find files that have characteristics similar to or the same as those rated highly by the user. After the matches are delivered, the user has a chance to further train the app, by rating the matches Autodate provides.
